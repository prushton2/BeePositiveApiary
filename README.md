# BeePositiveApiary
Repository for the website BeePositiveApiary.com

The website is a basic online store, however no payments are made online for security reasons. The database repo for the website is located [here](https://github.com/prushton2/BeePositiveApiaryNodeServer/blob/main/database.js)

I used NicePage to create the HTML and CSS for the website. I would love to upload the nicepage project aswell, but it costs money to transfer the unexported project
